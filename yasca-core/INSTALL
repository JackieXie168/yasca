                            INSTALLATION GUIDE

    Due to possible licensing conflicts, Yasca is distributed as a
    core package


    Installation Steps (Windows):

        1. Download yasca-core.zip and unzip it into a directory. For
           example, c:\yasca.

	    2. If you want to install all plugins, run:

             c:\yasca\resources\install-plugins.bat

           Otherwise, you can simply download the specific plugins that
           you want to install and unzip each of them into the Yasca
           installation directory.

		3. Install Java 1.5 or later. This is required for a few of the
           plugins. See doc/REQUIREMENTS for a full list.

             /opt/yasca/resources/install-plugins

           You will need unzip and curl installed.
